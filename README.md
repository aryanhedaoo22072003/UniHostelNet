# University Hostel Network (UniHostelNet)

## Abstract
UniHostelNet is a comprehensive web application designed to automate the administration of university hostels. As educational institutions grow, the demand for efficient student accommodation management increases. This project addresses the challenges faced by hostel administrators by streamlining various management tasks, including room assignments, attendance tracking, complaint resolutions, and maintaining student records. The system is built with a user-friendly interface and robust access control, ensuring efficient and reliable management of hostel operations.

- **Room Allocation**: 
  - Students can view available rooms and select one based on their preferences and availability.
  - The system automatically updates room status to prevent double bookings.

- **Attendance Management**: 
  - Facial recognition technology for marking attendance, reducing the need for manual roll calls.
  - Attendance records are stored securely and can be accessed by administrators for monitoring.

- **Complaint Management**: 
  - A dedicated section for students to report issues or concerns related to hostel facilities.
  - Admins can track, manage, and resolve complaints efficiently.

- **Admin Dashboard**: 
  - A centralized interface for administrators to manage student data, monitor attendance, and handle complaints.
  - Real-time statistics on room occupancy, attendance, and pending complaints.
